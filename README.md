Social Media based Election App

Team members: Ling Liu, Boya Hao

In this project, we explored insights embedded in social media data such as tweets regarding the two currently most promising candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
In detail, we build a realtime web application which visualizes the social media data in various ways. 
We also trained a deep-learning model using LSTM for sentiment analysis based on the self collected and labelled tweets.
